## 🧠 Concepts & Skills Demonstrated  
- **Artificial Intelligence** – Implementing Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.  
- **Game Logic Design** – Handling turns, win/draw detection, and reset logic.  
- **React Fundamentals** –  Component-based UI development and event handling with JSX.
- **Responsive Web Design** – Using CSS for cross-device compatibility.

## 🧠 How the AI Works
The game sends the current board state to the OpenRouter API,  
and the AI responds with its chosen move.  
We’ve set the AI temperature to a low value for consistent, logical play.
